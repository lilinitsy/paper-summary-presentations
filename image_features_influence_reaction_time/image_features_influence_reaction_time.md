## Motivation
In FPS games, players may find themselves shooting at differently constructed models. In QL for instance, you can choose which playermodel enemies appear as, as well as their colour; a certain subset of colours may be optimal (most players seem to choose bright green, bright blue, or bright pink). For non-arena shooters, colours are often duller.


## Background
Much work has been done on modeling temporal acurity of the HVS, but not on reaction, which is highly important for FPS's and other types of games. Eye fixation changes 3-4 times per second with saccades, which are rapid exploratory movements. These help us understand our surroundings.

Gaze-contingent rendering, where eyes are tracked at a high frequency and gaze locations are found, have been well developed. Dynamic foveated rendering is one such method, but others could be applying other effects such as DoF.

Saccade amplitude, velocity, and duration are not linear, but often follow a bell-shaped profile; so, a high speed eye tracker could predict where an ongoing saccade could end, which could help accelerate rendering techniques. Additionally, "saccadic suppression" is temporary perceptual blindness (failure to notice objects), which occurs during and shortly after a saccade.
